# Report 

**Important:**

- Was unable to implement sound

- Physical buttons are assumed to have raised labeling
The report starts from this line

### Good Design
- Braille next to each button

- Buttons are highlighted once selected

- Emergency lights for rare situations

### Bad Design
- Numbering of buttons is less intuitive

- No information about each floor and floors are queued up immediately

- Unclear how the phone icon and bell icon differ

### Design Improvements and Preventing Errors

- Allow users to back out of floor selection

- Allow users to cancel calling emergency services

- Number floors intuitively

- Show floor information

### Designing for disabilities

- Raised lettering on physical buttons because less than 10% of blind users are Braille literate

- Bold colors, and large info text will help those who are near blind and hard of hearing

- Sound of info text will help those who cannot see 

- Touch screen lower to the ground that provides haptic feedback
